AWS CloudFormation Template README
What This Template Does
This CloudFormation template is designed to help you set up an Elastic Beanstalk environment in AWS with built-in auto-scaling capabilities. It creates an Elastic Beanstalk application, an Elastic Load Balancer, and an Auto Scaling group. The Auto Scaling group automatically adjusts the number of instances based on CPU utilization to ensure optimal performance.

What You Need
Before using this CloudFormation template, make sure you have:

An AWS account.
Basic knowledge of AWS CloudFormation and how to navigate the AWS Management Console.
How to Deploy the Template
Follow these steps to deploy the template:

Provide Parameters: When you initiate the CloudFormation stack creation, you'll need to specify values for various parameters. These parameters include things like the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) ID, the name of your stack, the type of EC2 instances you want to use, and more.

Stack Creation: Launch the CloudFormation stack using the AWS Management Console or the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). Make sure to provide the required parameter values when prompted during the stack creation process.

Review Resources: After the stack creation is complete, review the AWS resources that have been provisioned. You should see the Elastic Beanstalk application, environment, Auto Scaling group, and Elastic Load Balancer.

Optional Tag Configuration: If you need to configure tag propagation for instances created by the Auto Scaling group, you can do this through the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI. Please note that tag propagation is not a property that's set directly in the CloudFormation template.

Customizing the Template
You have the flexibility to customize this template to fit your specific requirements. You can add more AWS resources, adjust properties, or fine-tune Auto Scaling settings as needed.

Removing Resources
If you want to remove the AWS resources created by this CloudFormation stack, simply delete the stack using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.
